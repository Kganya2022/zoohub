                <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                <p>The eastern gorilla (Gorilla beringei) is a critically endangered species of the genus Gorilla and the largest living primate. At present, the species is subdivided into two subspecies. There are 6,800 eastern lowland gorillas or Grauer's gorillas (G. b. graueri)[4] and 1,000 mountain gorillas (G. b. beringei).
                    Illegal hunting threatens the species.</p>

                <p>The eastern gorilla is a large hominid with a large head, broad chest, and long arms. It has a flat nose with large nostrils. The face, hands, feet and breast are bald. The fur is mainly black, but adult males have a silvery "saddle" on their back. When the gorilla gets older, the hair on the saddle of the back becomes white, much like the gray hair of elderly people.
 This is why the older males are called silverbacks. Grauer's gorilla has a shorter, thicker, deep black fur, while the mountain gorilla has a more bluish color. 
 The mountain gorilla is slightly smaller and lighter than Grauer's gorilla, but still larger and heavier than the western lowland gorilla and the Cross River gorilla.[citation needed] Males are much larger than females. 
 A full-grown male eastern gorilla typically weighs 140to205.5 kg (309to453 lb) and stands 1.7 m (5.6 ft) upright and a female typically weighs 90to100 kg (200to220 lb) and stands 1.5 m (4.9 ft) tall.[9][10] The tallest silverback recorded was a 1.95-metre (6.4 ft) individual shot in Alimbongo, northern Kivu in May 1938.[11] 
 The heaviest gorilla recorded was a 1.83-metre (6.0 ft) silverback shot in Ambam, Cameroon, which weighed 267 kilograms (589 lb),[11] although the latter area is within the range of the western gorilla, far outside that of the eastern gorilla.</p>

                <p>Gorillas are found in the forests of central and western Africa</p>
